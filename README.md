# Horiseon

## Purpose
A website that offers SEO, Social Media Marketing and Online Reputation Management.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS

## Main Quality of Life Changes:
In CSS I condensed multiple lines of redundant coding, adusted semantics to match changes done in HTML. I'm sure other things but I made the mistake of working and commiting at the end and not as key changes were made.
In HTML I made the website more accessible by defining the photos using alt.  I also got made the div more specific in the header, footer, article, etc sections. Fixed a link that wasn't working in the header. Added <br> for proper spacing. I feel okay about the changes, I feel like it could be cleaner but I don't have the skills yet to identify and solve.
